# Search

You can now easily search anything on the Hub with **Full-text search**. We index all model cards, dataset cards, and Spaces app.py files.

Using the search bar at the top of https://huggingface.co, you can select "Try Full-text search" to find what you seek on the Hub across models, datasets, and Spaces:
